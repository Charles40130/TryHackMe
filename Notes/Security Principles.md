- **Confidentiality** ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
- **Integrity** aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
- **Availability** aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.

#### Bell-LaPadula Model
- **Simple Security Property** : This property is referred to as “no read up”; it states that a subject at a lower security level cannot read an object at a higher security level. This rule prevents access to sensitive information above the authorized level.
- **Star Security Property** : This property is referred to as “no write down”; it states that a subject at a higher security level cannot write to an object at a lower security level. This rule prevents the disclosure of sensitive information to a subject of lower security level.
- **Discretionary-Security Property** : This property uses an access matrix to allow read and write operations. An example access matrix is shown in the table below and used in conjunction with the first two properties.

#### Clark-Wilson Model
- **Constrained Data Item (CDI)** : This refers to the data type whose integrity we want to preserve.
- **Unconstrained Data Item (UDI)** : This refers to all data types beyond CDI, such as user and system input.
- **Transformation Procedures (TPs)** : These procedures are programmed operations, such as read and write, and should maintain the integrity of CDIs.
- **Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs)** : These procedures check and ensure the validity of CDIs.
